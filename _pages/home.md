I am a PhD student in computational data analysis at the <a href='https://www.helsinki.fi/en
'>University of Helsinki</a> and part of the Helsinki Urological
Cancer Center (<a href='https://www.hucc.fi/'>HUCC</a>). At HUCC, I am actively involved in the development of innovative methodologies to analyse and enhance existing clinical practices related to Prostate Cancer (PCa) treatment at <a href='https://www.hus.fi/en'>Helsinki University Hospital (HUS)</a>. Our primary objective is to prevent
unnecessary treatment and overdiagnosis.

My PhD thesis revolves around designing, creating, and utilising statistics and AI models to profile PCa and predict its
outcomes.

<br /> I'm mainly interested in:

- Data-driven clinical data acquisition, curation, and model validation.
- Supervised/Unsupervised learning on biomedical datasets.
- Statistics and Machine learning for healthcare and science.
