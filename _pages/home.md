I am a PhD student in data science at the <a href='https://www.helsinki.fi/en'>University of Helsinki</a> and part of the Helsinki Urological Cancer Center (<a href='https://www.hucc.fi/'>HUCC</a>). At HUCC, I am actively developing computational methods to analyse and enhance existing clinical practices related to Prostate Cancer (PCa) treatment at <a href='https://www.hus.fi/en'>Helsinki University Hospital (HUS)</a>. Our primary objective is to prevent unnecessary treatment and overdiagnosis by leveraging clinical and imaging data.

My PhD thesis revolves around developing Machine learning and statistical models to profile PCa and predict its outcomes.

<br /> I'm mainly interested in:

- Machine learning and statistics for science and healthcare.
- Supervised/Unsupervised learning (multi)models.
- Data acquisition, curation, and model validation.
